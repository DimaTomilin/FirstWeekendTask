So I finished my first weekend tast.  
It is my project that I did. It is Technical Documentation Page of **CSS**. I adding main for my opinion of **CSS** and I think that can help to people understand what it is and to do first steps in CSS and front-end developing.  
So in my **CSS**page I told about:  
-Basic anatomy of **CSS**  
-Types of selectors  
-About boxes in **CSS** and how it work  
-A little about pseudo classes what it is  
-What it is @media function  
It is not enough to start writing style code in **CSS** but it can be gradual start in this deraction.
